                Bumblebee Pilot: "We're disengaged. Goin' for minimum safe distance."
                <br><br>Panicking Marine: "We're gonna make it, aren't we, sir? I don't wanna die out here!" The Chief pats him on the shoulder.
                <br><br> Cortana: "Look!" The Chief steps up front. Halo swings into view and the Bumblebee drops towards it
                <br><br> Marine: "What is that thing, Lieutenant?" Bumblebee Pilot: "Hell if I know, but we're landin' on it." Panicking Marine: "The Autumn! She's been hit!" The Chief dashes to the back of the lifeboat, and watches the Autumn.
                <br><br> Cortana: "I knew it! The Autumn's accelerating, Keyes is going in manual!" The Autumn is struck multiple times by Plasma Torpedoes.
                <br><br> Bumblebee Pilot: "Heads up everyone, this is it! We're entering the ring's atmosphere in five!" Cortana: "Sure you wouldn't rather take a seat?" Master Chief: "We'll be fine." The Chief grips the sides of the lifeboat, and bends
                his knees.
                <br><br> Cortana: "If I still had fingers, they'd be crossed..." The Bumblebee heads into Installation 04's atmosphere.
                <br><br> Fade to black.
                <br> Level ends.
